HLElasticView
============

HLElasticView is a UIView subclass that supports elastic snapping. It is inspired by UIScrollView's rubber band bouncing and [Facebook Paper](http://www.facebook.com/paper).

Spring and damping constants are defined in HLElasticView.m and can be modified to change the elasticity.
